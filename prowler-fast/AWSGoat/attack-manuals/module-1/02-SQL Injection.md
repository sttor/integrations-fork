# Objectives

Perform SQL Injection on the web application.

# Solutions

You can create a new user from the register page, and log in to the application.

Next, go to the user tab. There you can see the general data of all the users that are currently registered. You can try and search for individual users first. To get the data of all the users, you can use the most commonly used command in SQLi attacks, i.e. :

```
' or '1'='1
```

Here, we are passing an OR statement and passing a condition, 1=1 which will always be true. Hence we are getting access to the data of all the users. To pass our input as a SQL command rather than a simple string, we are using the single quote. Single quotes in SQL are character limiters that test whether the strings are properly escaped in the target application. If not, we can use a single quote (') to add SQL code after that.

If you inspect the page after the command and look out for the request payload, you will get an output like this:

Now comes the important step. Open BurpSuite on your desktop and navigate to Proxy in the setup. From there, click on 'Open browser' to use Burp's embedded browser. The advantage of an embedded browser is that the proxy settings are configured automatically in it. Initially, keep the intercept as 'OFF'. You will need to turn it on later.

Now, copy the lambda request URL to Burpsuite's embedded browser. Again login to the application using the credentials given above and then go to the Users tab. Then, go to BurpSuite and now turn the intercept 'ON'. We are doing this because now we want to intercept the next request that we send to the user. Then go back to the embedded browser and in the search user field, pass any random input, e.g h. We are doing this because we just need to intercept this request for further commands.
Go back to BurpSuite and forward the request, you will get an output that you need to send to the repeater. Take a look at the image below to understand it well:

A burp repeater is a tool that is designed to allow the user or attacker to change or resend a particular HTTP request and analyze the response generated by it, and that is exactly what we need to do here. After intercepting the request, we will send the request to the repeater so that we can manually change parameters, and request methods, to see the response.

Now all that is left to do to complete our SQLi attack is to change the parameters manually to get the desired response. We need to alter the 'value' and 'authlevel' parameters and replace their values with the following:

```
"value":"hello' or '1'='1"
"authlevel":"hello' or '1'='1"
```

After changing the parameters, click on 'send' to send the request.
Check the response, you will see that we have successfully managed to gain access to most of the data for all the users, even sensitive data like phone, address, ids, etc. This completes our SQLi attack. You can look at the image below to see the final output containing all the sensitive data as well.
