Author's Notes:

Hey guys, I thought I would do a little contribution!

I have always been spending over 1 hour to create the runway numbers from images. I came across a PDF which demenstrated the numbering in massive detail (How big they should be, lengths, widths etc).. I have been relying on this since I have been developing, taking screenshots, trimming around the numbers etc it took too long.

So I decided to make a font out of it, now I can very easily just type the numbers and select the font...job done, ready for further editing and detail adding.

This is my first time making a font, maybe not perfect, but it is a try and it does work and saves alot of time. The font name is "ICAORWYID.ttf", but it installs as "hhh.ttf".

You may download it, use it in anything you want and do whatever you want with it, however, if you edit it/update it/perfect it - in some way, upload it here.
