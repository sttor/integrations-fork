/**
 * XZ data compression support.
 *
 * <h2>Introduction</h2>
 * <p>
 * This aims to be a complete implementation of XZ data compression
 * in pure Java. Features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Full support for the .xz file format specification version 1.2.1</li>
 * <li>Single-threaded streamed compression and decompression</li>
 * <li>Single-threaded decompression with limited random access support</li>
 * <li>Raw streams (no .xz headers) for advanced users, including LZMA2
 *     with preset dictionary</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Threading is planned but it is unknown when it will be implemented.
 * <p>
 * For the latest source code, see the
 * <a href="https://tukaani.org/xz/java.html">home page of XZ for Java</a>.
 *
 * <h2>Getting started</h2>
 * <p>
 * Start by reading the documentation of {@link org.tukaani.xz.XZOutputStream}
 * and {@link org.tukaani.xz.XZInputStream}.
 * If you use XZ inside another file format or protocol,
 * see also {@link org.tukaani.xz.SingleXZInputStream}.
 *
 * <h2>Authors</h2>
 * XZ for Java is developed and maintained by Lasse Collin.
 * <p>
 * Major parts of XZ for Java are based on code written by
 * Igor Pavlov in the <a href="https://7-zip.org/sdk.html">LZMA SDK</a>.
 * <p>
 * Other authors:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Brett Okken
 * </ul>
